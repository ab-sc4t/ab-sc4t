# ***Hello everyone, Ayush Bansal this side...***
I am currently pursuing my 3rd year of B.Tech (Computer Science) from Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, Noida.


I am currently a third-year B.Tech student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with a strong passion for full-stack development and a keen interest in startups. 
My journey in tech has provided me with a solid foundation in Web2 technologies, and I am actively learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to further enhance my skills. 
As I continue to expand my expertise, I am excited to explore the emerging field of Web3.
